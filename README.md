DATASET

The training dataset consists of a balanced collection of images for each class: cats, deers, dogs, and horses. The dataset is split into training and validation sets to evaluate the model's performance.

MODEL ARCHITECTURE

The classification model is built on top of the MobileNet architecture, a lightweight and efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) suitable for mobile and embedded vision applications.

RESULTS

The model achieved an impressive 95% accuracy on the training set and 92% accuracy on the validation set.

FUTURE WORK

Fine-tune the model to improve performance further.
Explore data augmentation techniques to enhance model generalization.
Extend the dataset with more diverse images of animals.
